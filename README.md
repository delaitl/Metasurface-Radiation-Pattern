# Metasurface-Radiation-Pattern
The main goal of this project is to compute the radiation pattern of a metasurface antenna by using Fast-Fourier Transform algorithm. 
This antenna is designed to radiate a broadside pencil beam at a frequency f = 17[GHz].

After a theoritical analysis, the Co-Polar and Cross-Polar radiation pattern is analysed.
The used code to get the graph is not provided in the repository.

Happy reading :)
